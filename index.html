            What they say about us ?
        </h1>

        <p class="p">
            "I recently completed the MERN stack development course at Clever Academy, and I must say, the teaching was exceptionally clear. The course was conducted in Tamil, which made it incredibly easy for me to grasp complex technologies. John, our course mentor, is not only a kind and friendly person but also keeps us updated on the latest industry trends. The daily tasks provided were instrumental in improving my coding skills and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, the course covered essential aspects such as resume building, creating a standout LinkedIn and Naukri profile, and mastering Git and GitHub usage. Learning how to push and clone projects on GitHub was a crucial skill, and the communication-building classes were invaluable. This course has been instrumental in enhancing my coding knowledge and preparing me for success in the IT industry."

        Workshop was very useful, easy to understand the concepts taught. And so much inspiring to become like you. Your parents must be proud of you. Only one thing I want to say is class can be little bit slower to understand each topic and if we see all the output and input screens in one screens it will be easier to follow. Thank you so much for your effort. Kindly conduct eveing classed for working ppl like 2 hours per day it will be much more helpful.
Once again congratulations to you and your team.
